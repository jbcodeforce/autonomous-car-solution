# Autonomous Car Ride Solution

This repository represents an event-driven solution for a simplified application to ride an autonomous car, also known as robot taxis.

We want to present how to apply event-storming and domain-driven design to identify the microservice in scope of the solution, and how to use AWS services to support the implementation and deployment.

## Business problem

Acme inc wants to offer a robottaxi ride application with mobile front end, to let passengers book an autonomous car to travel between two locations within the same city. We will take San Francisco as an example.

See full descriptions and design approach in [this note](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/eda-studies/solutions/autonomous-car/es-duplicate-evt/)


## Description

The solution approach is using Domain Driven Design and Event storming to illustrate the methodology to build EDA solution. For easy reading, we propose a mkdocs view by following [this link]().



## Installation

To create the infrastructure use the following commands:

```

```

## Usage

To demonstrate the solution:

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
